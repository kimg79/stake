    title: "What is Fiamma?",
    content: `<p>Fiamma is the first BTC-secured universal ZK settlement network, enabling general ZK use cases in the Bitcoin ecosystem while bringing BTC-secured ZK-proof verification to Ethereum and beyond. 
    Featuring deep integration with Babylon and BitVM, great decentralization, and a low entry barrier via its mobile nodes, Fiamma is determined to become the backbone of a scalable, decentralized, and secure BTC ecosystem. 
    It will become the hub for easy launch of ZK rollups and other ZK use cases in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>`,

    title: "How does Bitcoin Staking Work?",
    content: `<p>Signet Bitcoin holders lock their Signet Bitcoin using the trustless and self-custodial Bitcoin Staking script for a predetermined time (timelock) in exchange for voting power in an underlying PoS protocol. In return, Bitcoin holders will earn PoS staking rewards.</p><br />
      <p>Finality providers perform the voting. A Signet Bitcoin staker can create a finality provider by itself and self-delegate or delegate its voting power to a third-party finality provider.</p><br />
      <p>If a finality provider attacks the PoS system, the Signet Bitcoins behind the voting powers delegated to it will be subject to protocol slashing. This deters Signet Bitcoin stakers and finality providers from attacking the PoS system.</p>

  {
    title: "What is the goal of this testnet?",
    content: `<p>The testnet aims to ensure the security of staked Bitcoins by testing user interactions with the Signet BTC network. This lock-only network will not operate any PoS chain, meaning the only participants will be finality providers and Signet Bitcoin stakers.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: "What does this staking dApp allow me to do?",
    content: `<p>The staking dApp allows Signet Bitcoin holders to stake their Signet Bitcoin and delegate their voting power to a finality provider they select. Stakers can view their past staking history and on-demand unlock their stake for early withdrawal.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: "Does my Signet Bitcoin leave my wallet once staked?",
    content: `<p>Yes, it leaves your wallet. Your wallet will not show it as your available balance because it is locked. However, it is not sent to any third party. It is locked in a self-custodial contract you control. This means that any subsequent movement of the Signet Bitcoin will need your approval, and you are the only one who can unbond the stake and withdraw.</p>`,
  },
  {
    title: "Is my Signet Bitcoin Safe? Could I get slashed?",
    content: `<p>In this testnet, you are not required to sign any PoS slashing-related authorizations. Thus, in theory, the Signet Bitcoin in your self-custodial contract cannot be slashed due to the absence of your authorization.</p><br />

    <p>However, there are still risks associated with your Signet Bitcoin:</p><br />
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        1. Code security<br />
        There is an inherent risk that the code developed for Bitcoin staking has vulnerabilities or bugs. The Fiamma team has open-sourced the code, and it is under security audits.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        2. System reliability<br />
        The Bitcoin staking system may be slow, unavailable, or compromised, which may cause the staking service to be unavailable or compromised, potentially leading to Signet Bitcoin not being unbindable or not withdrawable.
      </li>
    </ol>

    title: "How long will it take for my stake to become active?",
    content: `<p>A stakeâ€™s status demonstrates the current stage of the staking process. All stake starts in a Pending state which denotes that the Signet Bitcoin Staking transaction does not yet have sufficient Signet BTC block confirmations. As soon as it receives 10 Signet Bitcoin block confirmations, the status transitions to <i>Overflow</i> or <i>Active</i>. A stake is <i>Overflow</i> if the system has already accumulated the maximum amount of Signet Bitcoin it can accept. Otherwise, the stake is <i>Active</i>. <i>Overflow</i> stake should be on-demand unbonded and withdrawn.</p>`,

  {
    title: "Do I get rewards for staking?",
    content: `<p>No. This is a locking-only testnet without a PoS chain. There is no PoS staking reward nor incentives for participation.</p>`,
